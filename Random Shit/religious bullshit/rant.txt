you are a sinner; You have god's word on it. "as it is written,There is none righteous no, not one:" "For all have sinned and come short of the glory of god.

You will die and be cast into the lake of firebecause of your sin; You have god's word on it" For the wages of sin is death..." "And death and hell were cast into the lake of fire.
This is the second death and whosoever was not found in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire." Revelations 420
You can not save or help yourself; You have god's word on it. "Not of works, lest any man should boast." But we are all as an unclean thing and all our righteousnesses are as filthy rags..."
"So then it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of god that sheweth mercy."
