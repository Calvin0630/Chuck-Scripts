Faygo

I love my Faygo
It's always there for me
When I'm down I take a sip
There's nothing else I need
I swear I'm not a jugallo
No, I'm not one of them
I just really like Faygo
Blueberry is the best

I don't wanna sleep
I don't wanna be awake either
Bland and dull It's killing me
I need something soon
There you we're on the steps
I went up to talk to you
We had a quick smoke
And you told me I should do more reading

I'm wasting away
getting worse every day
I feel like shit
I think I need a hit 
of that mango shit 
from faygo inc
I cried today
On the train
I feel so much guilt
For my pain

I found some strawberry today
I BOOFED blueberry yesterday
My brain's on fire, the Zaps won't quit
I need someone to deal with this
Blue is the best, better than the rest
Kind of like the Pokemon games

jesus


the clampdown

What are we gonna do now?

Taking off his turban, they said, is this man a Jew?
'Cause they're working for the clampdown
They put up a poster saying we earn more than you!
When we're working for the clampdown
We will teach our twisted speech
To the young believers
We will train our blue-eyed men
To be young believers

The judge said five to ten, but I say double that again
I'm not working for the clampdown
No man born with a living soul
Can be working for the clampdown
Kick over the wall 'cause government's to fall
How can you refuse it?
Let fury have the hour, anger can be power
D'you know that you can use it?
