1. Eventually 


as my whole world comes down around me 
show me no pity as i ease 
into a suicidal laughter 

with the setting sun, my father's gun is whispering 

and as my family dies from cancer 
i am teary-eyed and weak 
i'm not weary of disasters 

the end is numb, for everyone, eventually 

and as my friendships are decaying 
and we're all waking from the dream 
this dying day just ain't worth saving 

so i hide away, in my poison brain, trying to sleep


2. Loss Memory	


how do i wake up? 
how do i get free? 
tethered to an anchor of loss memory 

dreaming so long 
dreaming so lonely 

i get a phone call, no one's on the line 
i take in their silence 
and say my goodbyes 

dreaming so long 
dreaming so lonely


3. Phillip 02:14	


i woke up so tired 
drag me through the light 
i've been alone for so long 

hello sad world 
take me in, let me know 
i've been alone for so long 

i'm through begging off 
an eternity of loss 
i've been alone for so long 

so long


4. Tether 03:28


i'm the fucked up kid in school 
dead in the eyes of the rules 
i got sent home for throwing up 
my friends think being sick is cool 

and my dad beat up my mom 
because she's an alcoholic 
but he's an alcoholic too 
through the looking glass of abuse 

i want to sleep next to you 
after school before my mom calls 
to see when i'm coming home 

i can finally see where the tether ends 
mortally coiled around nothingness 

i'm the fucked up kid in school 
maybe i'll join the army 
no one will ever know me truly 
my rage has silenced a cry for help 

my mom's dealer put a gun to my head 
for a laugh, for his friends 
and in that moment i knew i could kill 
my mother's prison is herself 

i want to sleep next to you 
after school before my mom calls 
to see when i'm coming home 

i can finally see where the tether ends 
mortally coiled around nothingness


5. Thunder 02:38	


can you face me? 
i already know the answer 
if it's over, let's go our separate ways 

when the thunder calls to me then i'll come over 
i am waiting 
with an open mind 

i am drawn to the mirror in a dull revulsion 
i forgive you 
but i do not know why


6. Ambrosia in the Bitter World 02:35	


ambrosia in the bitter world 
i cling to your light to keep from sinking down 
the clouds rip open and the rain reaches out 
to the people who just want to drown 

and now my heart aches but it keeps pounding 
to crush my little world and leave me dreaming 
in endless silence, only of you 
ambrosia 

i was once a little girl, i was twisted into what i am now 
my heart is open but i don't know how to reach out and 
be a person so i up and drown 

and now my heart aches but it keeps pounding 
to crush my little world and leave me dreaming 
in endless silence, only of you 
ambrosia


7. Burden 03:04	


when you get off work 
come by my house, and lay your burden down 
may the world the keep spinning 
until it spirals out 
lay your burden down 

my mom's gone to california 
they got a treatment center there 
my mom had a fucked up childhood 
that's the burden that we both bear 
lay your burden down 

i quit drinking, 
but i still smoke, lay your burden down 
carried down a highway with 
nowhere else to go 
lay your burden down 

my mom's gone to california 
they got a treatment center there 
my mom had a fucked up childhood 
that's the burden that we both bear 
lay your burden down


8. Running Wide Open 02:43	


traffic lights turning blue 
everyone that we burn through 
only me and you, queen of booze 

ain't no furniture in our house 
no screaming and fighting anymore 
the living room turns blue 
we're both sleeping on the floor 

i want to be an engine 
running wide open 
running wide open until i can't run no more 

living with one eye closed and 
one eye on the cage door 
everyday is the day that i'll die 
and be afraid no more 
when dad found out about 
where we were hiding out 
he came down like a sea of rage, crashing onto the shore 

i want to be an engine 
running wide open 
running wide open until i can't run no more 

i let the years go by, i let no one know what's inside 
my broken heart keeps a beat just fine 
i don't want to die no more 
i see my future and my past 
all at once in a lightning flash 
all you can do is laugh until you just can't no more 

i want to be an engine 
running wide open 
running wide open until i can't run no more 

i want to be an engine 
running wide open 
running wide open until i can't run no more


9. Window 02:41	


closing my eyes when i drive 
back in my hometown, past every bar i've been thrown out 
i can't make it to class 
so i'm drunk in my car i 
can't roll my window up 

the glass is stuck in the door 

at home there's blood on my bed 
and no running water 
there is a room i don't go in i 
see myself through the door 
me and my mom used to hide there 
crying our prayers through a window 

a fig tree covered in water 
holds the moonlight like a prison


Sad World


rot me around your sword, paint me wet 
i don't want to dry out just yet 

rot me alcoholic womb, i want to burn my way through this world 
consumed with you 

i've got a bad idea 
let's lose our minds in love with bad ideas 
so long sad world, goodbye 

peeling back the skin, i want to see the mask 
you wear within, beneath your eyes 

gnawing at your mind 
i want to wither away in your love until i die 

i've got a bad idea 
let's lose our minds in love with bad ideas 
so long sad world, goodbye
