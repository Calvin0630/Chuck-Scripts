print('OK, seriously, Im fed up with nearly every day having to explain that Mudvayne is a progressive metal band. Im a fucking musicologist and a progressive rock composer. I shouldnt have to fucking explain what is blatantly obvious to people who arent paying attention and dont understand how musical genres work. Every person who has called Mudvayne a genre other than prog-metal is a poseur who has no understanding at all of musical theory. When you combine progressive rock, extreme metal genres and jazz into one style, it comes out as progressive metal. How many times do I have to fucking explain this? It should be common fucking knowledge.')
